# Displaying-Output-Square-Arterisks
Write an app that prompts the user to enter the size of the side of a square,                then displays a hollow square of that size made of asterisks.                Your app should work for squares of all side lengths between 1 and 20.                If the user enters a number less than 1 or greater than 20,                your app should display a square of size 1 or 20, respectively.
